In different areas of Earth, one might find sweltering deserts, dense tropical rainforests, or bone-chilling tundras. Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

History has shown us, however, that it's not so easy to form societies or communities that fulfill these requirements for all members. The fight over human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale. It has led to large-scale social movements and reforms concerning issues such as suffrage, slavery, women's rights, racial discrimination, environmentalism, gay rights, and more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg","altText":"Lifestyles & Social Issues","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg"}},{"id":12000,"title":"Literature","urlTitle":"Literature","description":"With the development of language, the human imagination has found a way to create and communicate through the written word. A literary work can transport us into a fictional, fantastic new world, describe a fleeting feeling, or simply give us a picture of the past through novels, poems, tragedies, epic works, and other genres. Through literature, communication becomes an art, and it can bridge and bond people and cultures of different languages and backgrounds.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/44/172844-131-9695C31F/word-communication-stress-accent-letters-syllable.jpg","altText":"Literature","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/44/172844-131-9695C31F/word-communication-stress-accent-letters-syllable.jpg"}},{"id":7000,"title":"Philosophy & Religion","urlTitle":"Philosophy-Religion","description":"Humans have long pondered not only how we came to be but also why we came to be. The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Thus, philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting inquiries such as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next? Why do heavy objects tend to fall downwards when dropped? How are birds able to fly (and why can’t I do the same?)? Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science. The modern-day sciences cover a vast range of fields, including biology, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, physics, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg","altText":"Science","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg"}},{"id":4000,"title":"Sports & Recreation","urlTitle":"Sports-Recreation","description":"Physical contests and recreational games have long played a part in human society. In both team and solo sports, the human body has been pushed to its limits in the name of improving athletic performance and to break record upon record. The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or can just be a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not—more fun, too!

They include the most ancient forms, such as painting and drawing, and the arts that were born thanks to the development of technology, like sculpture, printmaking, photography, and installation art, the latter a combination of multiple creative expressions. Though beauty is in the eye of the beholder, different eras in art history have had their own principles to define beauty, from the richly ornamented taste of the Baroque to the simple, utilitarian style of the Prairie School.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/45/24345-050-78FAA104.jpg","altText":"Visual Arts","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/45/24345-050-78FAA104.jpg"}},{"id":6000,"title":"World History","urlTitle":"World-History","description":"Does history really repeat itself, or can we learn from the mistakes of those who came before us?

Colour is rare, being limited to red or yellow irises of the eye in some species; red <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/beak" class="md-crosslink">beaks</a> or feet in a few; yellow brow tufts in the three species of <em>Eudyptes</em>; and orange and yellow on the head, neck, and breast in the emperor and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/king-penguin" class="md-crosslink">king</a> (<em>A. patagonica</em>) penguins.</p><!--[P2]--><span class="marker p2"></span><div class="assemblies"><div class=""><figure class="md-assembly card print-false" data-assembly-id="47975"><div class="md-assembly-wrapper" data-type="image"><a style="--aspect-ratio: 16/9" href="https://cdn.britannica.com/99/55499-004-E689E0D8/Heads-sphenisciforms.jpg" class="position-relative d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center media-overlay-link card-media" data-href="/media/1/449815/47975"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/s:690x388,c:crop/99/55499-004-E689E0D8/Heads-sphenisciforms.jpg" alt="sphenisciform head shapes" data-width="470" data-height="320"><button href="https://cdn.britannica.com/99/55499-004-E689E0D8/Heads-sphenisciforms.jpg" data-href="/media/1/449815/47975">sphenisciform head shapes</a><div class="md-assembly-caption text-muted font-14 font-serif">Heads of representative sphenisciforms.</div><cite class="credit d-block mt-5">Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.</cite></figcaption></figure></div></div><!--[AM2]--><span class="marker AM2 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD2]--><span class="marker MOD2 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">The total <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/population-biology-and-anthropology" class="md-crosslink">populations</a> of some species, such as the emperor, are estimated in the hundreds of thousands, but most species of smaller penguins certainly run into the millions. Immense island breeding colonies, some teeming with hundreds of thousands of nesting pairs, represent a large potential food resource, but the economic importance of penguins is negligible. Nineteenth-century whalers and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/seal-authentication" class="md-crosslink">seal</a> hunters visited some colonies for <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/meat" class="md-crosslink">meat</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/egg-biology" class="md-crosslink">eggs</a>, and a penguin oil industry once took large numbers of the birds. By the early 20th century, however, this exploitation was no longer profitable, and most colonies were left alone or actively protected. Some species are now increasing in numbers, apparently as a result of the mid-20th century’s decimation of Antarctic <a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/whale" class="md-crosslink">whales</a>, which compete with penguins for the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/krill" class="md-crosslink">krill</a> (minute <a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/crustacean" class="md-crosslink">crustaceans</a>) on which both feed. Penguin populations, however, are highly <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vulnerable" class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off" data-term="vulnerable">vulnerable</a> to changes in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/climate-meteorology" class="md-crosslink">climate</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ocean" class="md-crosslink">ocean</a> temperature, including recent <span id="ref1264612"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/global-warming" class="md-crosslink">global warming</a>.
